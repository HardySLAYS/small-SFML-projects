# SMALL AND FUN SFML PROJECTS

---

---

# INTRODUCTION

This is the collection of small fun projects I have created using the SFML library, a cross-platform Multimedia and Graphics library for C++.
\
I have created these projects in LINUX and have provided each project with its own Makefile, and tried to make them as modular as possible.
\
If you want to open these projects in windows, you need to know how to link the SFML library(either statically or dynamically) to your GNU/GCC compiler. You can do so using Visual Studio or Codeblocks IDE.

To learn how to compile SFML source codes in Visual Studio or CodeBlocks IDE, you can visit the official [SFML PAGE](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/).

# HOW TO COMPILE THE PROJECTS IN LINUX

You can use the Makefile to compile the source that would be provided. All the makefiles would have the same structur, if not specified uniquely.

> - To only compile the source code:
>   - **make game**
> - To only run the compiled file:
>   - **make run**
> - To compile the source code and run the executable:
>   - **make all**
> - To delete all the compiled object files and executable:
>   - **make clear**

# LIST OF PROJECTS:
 The list of projects currently added in the repo are:
 1. Crazy ball:
  > You have a crazy ball that loves bouncing here and there. It has just weakness, It cannot beat the gravity. Or can it? I guess with a little support(Force in upward direction).
 2. Snake Game
  > There's nothing much to tell. It is the classic snake game where you control a snake eating points and avoiding the walls and its body.

# FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT

These projects are nothing fancy as such, and are just created to uderstand the basics and applications of SFML integration in C++.
/
You can see these mini-projects and try them on your own to see if you can implement these basics, and maybe even make them more efficient then mine.
