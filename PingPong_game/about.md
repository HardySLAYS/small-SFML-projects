## INTRODUCTION:
This pingpong game is a minimal replica of the "Classic Ping Pong" game. It is a 2 playes game where each player has a platform on either side or the game board. The objective of a player is to deflect the incoming ball towards the opposite player by moving the platform in vertical direction and adjusting the hit of ball on platform instead of the wall.

If a player misses the ball, he losses that round and one point is gained by the opposite player. Whoever gets the maximum points first, winds the match.
